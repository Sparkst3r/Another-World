Another-World
=============

A work in progress space age minecraft mod.

Tyteon

This mod will add a new planet dimension, which will be called Tyteon.
The dimension has many space biomes with lots of alien fauna and flora.
Some of which are harmful to Steve. Others, very beneficial.
Oceans are present on this planet but are highly acidic and toxic.
One drop could cause Steve to lose a limb or be severely burned by the acid.
Under sea ravines and caves exist but getting to their secrets will be a challenge and late game.

I've had a new idea, to add a few more planets to visit. But Tyteon will remain the first and main planet you visit.
I may even add some sort of space map idea!


Preperation

Very little of this mod will be based in the overworld, but a lot of preperation for space travel will be needed there.
IC2 will play a large role in this mod, the spaceship is built using a lot of IC2 part such as the carbon fibre insulation made from carbon plates 
or the warp drive which uses a lot of iridium.
You will also need to explore the overworld a bit to aquire the plans for the ship. Advanced villagers can trade you blueprint parts, which then you will glue back together when you have
4 pieces. Then put the blueprint in a Thaumcraft research table to clean it up and make it legible by pouring aspect solvents on the text. Once it has been cleared up you can activate it like a standard TC3 research
and have it appear in the Thauminomicon. This will have instructions to create part of the ship, you will need to research many different blueprints though to get all of the ship parts!
Current ideas for ship parts.
    Airlock. If you step into space you're gonna have a bad time!
    Cryo Chamber. Where you will be while traveling as it will take a few weeks to get there.
    Warp drive. Very expensive! Thats about the extent of the description! :P With a price of the equivelent of 50 stacks of UU-matter! It's what makes the dimensions late game. Yeah I may add more dimensions in the future that are a bit OP so this is my balancing act.
        Warp upgrades such as additional Plasma drives to accelerate fast enough to get to certain future planets. And efficiency upgrades so it doesnt use as much fuel!
    
    
    



Space travel


You are to construct a spaceship and power it to get to Tyteon. Power will be provided by IC2 EU and BC3 MJ. You will need to power it with
BOTH power types as they both do different things for the spaceship. More MJ keeps the force barrier up and resists hull damage.
EU basically is the warp drive power so little EU = "Yer not gonna move"
