A work in progress space age Minecraft mod.

AnotherWorld is split up into separate expansion mods.

Core: Core does nothing, seriously, nothing. It is just the core mod for all the other expansions so attach to

World: World adds lots of world generation features (Config option too) and plently of new mobs.
Ores, adds the 4 ores needed for AnotherWorld, copper, tin, silver and lead. Will use the OreDictionary to find ores.
Bees, bees are a mob added by AnotherWorld, they pollinate flowers and produce honey.

Mechanical: The age of gears and cranks, lots of very basic tech its the step up from Minecraft's tech stage.
