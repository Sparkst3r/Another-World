Another-World
=============

A work in progress space age minecraft mod.

Tyteon

This mod will add a new planet dimension, which will be called Tyteon.
The dimension has many space biomes with lots of alien fauna and flora.
Some of which are harmful to Steve. Others, very beneficial.
Oceans are present on this planet but are highly acidic and toxic.
One drop could cause Steve to lose a limb or be severely burned by the acid.
Under sea ravines and caves exist but getting to their secrets will be a challenge and late game.

Preperation

Very little of this mod will be based in the overworld, but a lot of preperation for space travel will be needed there.
IC2 will play a large role in this mod, the spaceship is built using a lot of IC2 part such as the carbon fibre insulation made from carbon plates 
or the warp drive which uses a lot of iridium.



Space travel


You are to construct a spaceship and power it to get to Tyteon. Power will be provided by IC2 EU and BC3 MJ. You will need to power it with
BOTH power types as they both do different things for the spaceship. More MJ keeps the force barrier up and resists hull damage.
EU basically is the warp drive power so little EU = "Yer not gonna move"
